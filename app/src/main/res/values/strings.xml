        It is similar to two other golden plovers, Eurasian and Pacific.

        <h1>The American Golden Plover</h1>

        is smaller, slimmer and relatively longer-legged than Eurasian Golden Plover (<i>Pluvialis apricaria</i>) which also has white axillary (armpit) feathers.

        It is more similar to Pacific Golden Plover (<i>Pluvialis fulva</i>) with which it was once <b>considered</b> conspecific under the name \"Lesser Golden Plover\".

        The Pacific Golden Plover is slimmer than the American species, has a shorter primary projection, and longer legs, and is usually yellower on the back.

    <p>
        These birds forage for food on tundra, fields, beaches and tidal flats, usually by sight. They eat insects and crustaceans, also berries.
