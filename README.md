# UltradianX  _(ud801_CapStone)_

The _Ultradian eXplorer_ is an Android app, 
    aiming to serve as a mindful tracking tool, 
    by which one can explore ones ultradian rhythm, usefully.


## Background

As a proposed foundation of strategic belief, 
    that is, ___if you want to acquire certain skills, 
    you have to work on them daily, to be the most efficient,
    even when touched only briefly___  (< 10 min), 
    so you can make a habit out of them, or at least invite to the idea:
    ___"You are an explorer exploring that particular domain."___

Thereby we call each domain or individual endeavour, 
    an ___Adventure___.

Inspired by the concept of ___ultradian rhythms___, 
    those 90 min partitions of the circadian cycle,
    determining the experience of the day.    
Although not at all a scientific endeavor, 
    the user may find it useful to explore the idea, 
    as the app purpose is to present the user, 
    how he has spent his time. Not to suggested to change any habits, 
    or to even give any advise how they are supposed to be spent. 
    
Just that one may experience them more consciously,
    so first one gains an understanding what one needs are and thereby who oneself is.
    
and helps to not get lost, when immersed in a particular task. 


Its target is to weaken that wall that appears when something worth pursuing
    has not been pursued for a while 

Overall it tries to help with _atelic_ pursues which have no explicit endpoint, 
    in contrast to _telic_ ones, which do.    



## Strategies & Benefits

+ to start the day what seems most important, that which have the highest priority

+ if you have started some domain and you notice that proceeding it,
  serves fun and interest, continue doing it, as to say give it a higher degree of importance

+ to allow the present moment to decide what the next task might/should be
  (free scheduler, like free jazz)

+ so have th advantages of a daily routine, continuously working something, 
  without the drawbacks, that only a limited amount can be handled daily



## Paid vs. Free version

In the Free version, in addition to every suggestion page popping up periodically,
there is a google advertising frame showing at the bottom of the page,
until the user touches the screen.
