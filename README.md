# UltradianX

The _Ultradian eXplorer_, 
    an app aiming to serve as a tool, 
    by which one can explore ones ultradian rhythm, usefully.


## Background

The foundation is the belief 
    that if you want to acquire certain skills, 
    you have to work on them every day,
    even if touched only briefly  (< 10 min), 
    so you can make a habit out of them. 

This idea is juxtaposed to that of ultradian rhythms, 
    those 90 min partitions of the circadian cycle. 

It shall be noted here, 
    that it doesn't claim to be a scientific endeavor at all.


Its target is to weaken that wall that appears when something worth pursuing
    has not been pursued for a while 

Overall it tries to help with _atelic_ pursues which have no explicit endpoint, 
    in contrast to _telic_ ones, which do.    



## Strategies & Benefits

+ to start the day what seems most important, that which have the highest priority

+ if you have started some domain and you notice that proceeding it,
  serves fun and interest, continue doing it, as to say give it a higher degree of importance

+ to allow the present moment to decide what the next task might/should be
  (free scheduler, like free jazz)

+ so have th advantages of a daily routine, continuously working something, 
  without the drawbacks, that only a limited amount can be handled daily



## Paid vs. Free version

there is a google advertising frame showing at the bottom of the page,
until the user touches the screen.
