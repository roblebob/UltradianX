# UltradianX

The _Ultradian eXplorer_, 
    an app aiming to serve as a tool, 
    by which one can explore ones ultradian rhythm, usefully.


## Background

The foundation is the belief 
    that if you want to acquire certain skills, 
    you have to work on them every day,
    even if touched only briefly  (< 10 min), 
    so you can make a habit out of them. 

This idea is juxtaposed to that of ultradian rhythms, 
    those 90 min partitions of the circadian cycle. 

It shall be noted here, 
    that it doesn't claim to be a scientific endeavor at all.







## Paid vs. Free version

In the Free version, in addition to every suggestion page popping up periodically, 
there is a google advertising frame showing at the bottom of the page, 
until the user touches the screen.
